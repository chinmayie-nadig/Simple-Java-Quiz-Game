Simple-Java-Quiz-Game

A Java-based quiz game with ten multiple-choice questions and growing cash rewards is called the Crorepathi Application. Correct answers allow players to proceed; incorrect answers terminate the game. Three lifelines (50-50, Ask the Audience, and Skip Question) are included in the game and can be used once each to help. The project is a fun learning exercise for beginners because it uses Java to demonstrate control structures, user input handling, and decision-making logic.

Players can win increasing cash rewards by answering 10 multiple-choice questions in the interactive quiz game. Since a single mistake ends the game, the challenge is to answer every question correctly. In order to help players, the game offers three lifelines (50-50, Ask the Audience, and Skip Question), each of which can only be used once. The goal is to create an organized and entertaining quiz system in Java that ensures fair gameplay, manages user interactions efficiently, and promotes lifeline restrictions while offering a fluid and dynamic gaming experience.

•	10 questions with 4 options each question having rewards as rupees.
•	Only if the answer is correct he can proceed to next question.
•	If answer is wrong then his game will end.
•	This game comes with 3 life lines : Audience Phone, 50-50 and Skip.
•	Each life line can be used only 1 time.
•	Life line can be used in any question.
•	If a life line is used then it cannot be displayed if user select lifelines.

The quiz game is implemented in an organized manner by the Application. The following steps are part of the methodology:

•	A welcome message and a request for the player's name are displayed at the beginning of the game.
•	The starting prize is ₹10.
•	There are four multiple-choice answers for every question.
•	After the player chooses an answer, its accuracy is verified.
•	The player advances to the next question with a higher prize if the response is accurate.
•	The game is over right away if the answer is wrong.
•	Three lifelines are available to players, each of which can only be used once: 50-50, Ask the Audience, and Skip Question. 
•	By lowering the number of possible answers, pointing out the right response, or bypassing the question, the lifelines assist the player.
•	 A lifeline can't be used again for the rest of the game. 
•	Until the player chooses the incorrect response or correctly answers all ten questions, the game is over. 
•	Before the game is over, the total prize amount is shown. 
•	Programming Language: Java.
•	Concepts Used: Loops, conditional statements.

The ten multiple-choice questions in this Java-based quiz game require users to choose the right response in order to advance; giving the wrong response ends the game. The application handles lifeline selection, answer selection, and name entry using the ‘Scanner’ class for user input. Conditional statements are used to structure the questions, each of which has four possible answers. Correctness is checked against pre-established answers. Three lifelines are available in the game: Ask the Audience (which suggests the right answer), 50-50 (which eliminates two incorrect options), and Skip Question (which permits skipping a question). Each lifeline can be used once. Flags (lifeline1, lifeline2, lifeline3) are used to track lifelines. Correct answers allow the player to advance and earn more rewards; incorrect answers cause the game to end. This well-organized implementation guarantees fluid gameplay with lifeline functionality and efficient input handling.

Using multiple-choice questions, the Crorepathi Application is a Java-based quiz game which provides an engaging and organized method of knowledge assessment. By limiting growth to right answers and including three lifelines to help players, the game guarantees fair play. The game is made interesting and user-friendly by the incorporation of lifeline management, question handling, and user input processing. The fundamental features of a quiz system are effectively demonstrated by this project, which could be improved with the addition of more questions, a scoring system, or a graphical user interface.
